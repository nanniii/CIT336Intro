	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>
	My name is Will Bender and I am a Junior in Computer Science here at Pace. My expected date of graduation is May 2019 and I'm from Trumbull, CT. I am taking this class to kickstart my want to create a interactive more 'fun' website as I purchased (then released) a domain one year ago because I never did anything with it (wanted to have my own email domain). I am eager to take this class while using Lynda to further excel!  </p>
	<h2>My&nbspProgramming&nbspExperience</h2>
	<p>
	I love tinkering with arduinos and (as of last semester) coding to interact with my iPhone using Swift. My most recent project involves the use of an arduino with my iPhone app where I can unlock my car when I am in the proximity using Bluetooth 4.0! 
	I've dabbled with HTML/Javascript in highschool and over this past summer for a Web Computing course; though, a lot of it is still new to me. 
	</p>
	<h2>
		My future goals
	</h2>
	<p>
		I definitely want a career in technology. I  have a strong interest in coding the IOT (internet of things), app development. I really think that being able to leverage scripting languages such as PHP and javascript will be worthwhile to learn and also enjoyable.

	<h2>Whats that picture behind you?</h2>
	<p>
		I was just in Ecuador for a month and a half! That picture was taken at Quilatoa Lake with a momma and baby Alpaca! The trek down was so worth it to meet them in indigenous outfit. Last year I travelled to Chile, where I backpacked for 8 days in the wilderness of Patagonia to soak in nature's beauty and glory. I live to travel and hopefully I can make that as part of my job.
